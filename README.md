# NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE

Try it out:
 - `npm install`
 - `npm run build`
 - `npm start`

This will start with a random neural network with 3 output nodes. The goal is to return an output that matches `[1, 0, 0]`.

It will run 500 generations, which should result in the top performing network with the desired result.

#### This is a VERY basic implementation, intended to be used to explore and experiment with evolutionary neural networks.
